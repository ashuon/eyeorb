	<p>i've been collecting otaku merchandise since 2020. (the year i got my own card, although it was one of those prepaid kinds for kids, controlled by parents...)
the very first figure i got was remilia scarlet from touhou project, for my birthday in october 2020..!!! i still love her a lot but komeijis reign supreme above all
other touhous i fear... here is a picture <br>

i also have a decent collection of other anime figures as well... i've been accumulating them slowly over the course of 5 years. i have had MUCH more in the past,
but ive either sold them or gave them to family members lmao... picture below<br>

i need more stuff of my goats (komeijis) and speaking of komeijis... i must show my ita bag of them because i love them so much (though i still feel like it could be improved)

i am very very passionate about merchandise, and have even made some myself.. i made keychains of shimeji simulation characters (majime and shijima) and ayana otonashi. i really
want to make more keychains, but they cost a lot of money to manufacture... i get mine from vograce and theyre really nice quality, and for a understandable price ($50 for 20 ayanas, $42 for 12 shimejis..) but ouhhh i live in the united states and oggg the tariffs are gonna GET vograce shaking my head i hope orange guy lifts the china tariffs eventually because i need to make more keychains and other kinds of merch perhaps like stickers.... i may be really materialistic because of my passion for merchandise but whatever its my money<br></p>
