	<p>since i was little, i have always liked media of an interpretive or open ended nature,
especially ones of the surreal genre..... in a previous (much more schloppity schlop) blogpost,
i had talked about something along the lines of this, so i will expand on that in a better way here. <br></p>
<p>some examples of surreal media that fit this category are <b>angel's egg (1985)</b> and <b>cat soup (2001)</b>, two
of my favorite movies of all time. (my only favorite movies tbh... i dont really watch movies much) they are both
very very beautiful and of a surreal nature, something that fits my niche perfectly. for me, i really like stories where
the setting/plot is something unrealistic and out of this world in a peculiar or unique way. such as shimeji simulation, for another example... there is
great significance to me for stories where the author just lets their imagination run wild. i think that stories where its in way too realistic of a setting
are very boring.............. but this can depend of course..! i really like hidamari sketch even though there isnt really anything avant-garde about it...<br></p>
<p>avant-garde things, i really like in general. i like it when people create fiction or ideas that go out of the norm, even if it isnt always
appealing to me.... as of late, the mainstream media of today's society seems to be imploding on itself. big movie studios only want to make remakes of
their biggest hits for nostalgia bait, and when they DO make original stories again, they barely advertise them. and for books, it really seems like so many people
only want to consoom the schloppiest shit but maybe thats just booktok lmao, i dont use tiktok but i hear of stuff from it a lot... i try to buy books that appeal to me and are
classics and/or avant-garde, such as house of leaves and moby dick. i also read 1984 in school, for classics... getting back on topic, anime is victim of the sloppification as well.
why do so many anime studios greenlight manga titled like &quot;I Got Transported To The Nether World And My Little Sister Is A Magical Demon God And She's In My Harem?!?!?&quot; and not
stuff like shimeji simulation siiigh many people of today have no standards they just consoom whatever slop is put on their plate it seems.... i mean
to each their own i guess but i really wish studios didn't just greenlight whatever would make the most money... <br></p>
<p>i really want to make my own thing with my vague ideas one day, but i doubt i have the mental strength to deal with a wide audience for it... i already cant handle stupid
people talking about my interests lol. maybe one day ill make my own cool surreal video game or other piece of art... though, sometimes it just Never gets far. one of my
favorite rpgmaker games of all time is ghost suburb 2, yet nobody ever really talks about it except for the nichest of circles. which is good but also annoying because theres little
discussion or fanart of it lol, please play it if you have a chance it's on gamejolt <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/ghost-suburb-ii-from-sleep-into-the-eyes-of-madness/20897">here...!!!</a>
