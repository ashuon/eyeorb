          <h1>energy - 3/22/25</h1>
          <p>
            i have been feeling an extreme amount of low energy, and its only
            getting worse.... i recently got diagnosed with anemia so that
            explains it but i havent been taking anything to help it which is My
            Fault. i can't really do much without getting tired and wanting to
            lay down... i do want to get better but also at the same time its
            like i dont care whatsoever. i have adhd too so i doubly cannot get
            myself to do much... it really seems like whenever i have a glimmer
            of hope to fix something in my life that it gets changed or taken
            away a while after. one example of this is actually having adhd meds
            that i can be fine with, my mom ordered the transdermal adhd
            medicine patch for me but it kept getting backordered over and over
            and i dont think theyll ever have it in stock, so i have to take
            pills soon instead and i really really really hate taking
            pills................ i constantly have opportunities given to me to
            make my life better but i don't take them, and i can't take any
            advice, i'm really stubborn

        <h1>anniversary of nekoweb account - 2/25/25</h1>
        <p>
          today marks the 1 year anniversary of having a nekoweb dot org account
          and using it. one year ago, i had a then-used neocities, and i had
          used my nekoweb for a simple about page for twitter/tumblr at the
          time.. (FUCK CARRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK RENTRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
          STRAWPAGE SOMETIMES TOO... i frequently hate users of all three of
          these things Especially rentry grrr)
        </p>
        <img src="pictures/first_eye_edition.PNG" width="300" />
        <p>
          it looked like this ^ very low effort indeed... i can code better
          simple about pages now (<a href="https://phenonemon.tumblr.com/uwah"
            >example</a
          >). i have improved in web design so much in a simple year, and
          including my time in neocities, YEARS... and nekoweb changed my life
          extremely...... ive made a lot of friends from it<br />
          basically i am very thankful for nekoweb existing because i have made
          3 billion friends from it :pray: shoutout to my nekoweb server oomfs
          and all my friends.. here is to a long lasting nekoweb community even
          if theres drama sometimes

        <h1>moe... - 2/17/25</h1>
        <p>
          lets pray this is my first coherent post....<br />
          oftentimes when people think about "moe", they think of big anime eyes
          and general cuteness... but what about unconventional "moe" traits? it
          could be anything you find cute within the realm of otakuism, in my
          opinion... for me, there are many things i like that i consider moe.
          some of these things include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>bandages</li>
          <li>blood</li>
          <li>collared capelet/capelet in general</li>
          <li>eyepatch (not the pirate kind)</li>
          <li>eye motifs</li>
          <li>floppy sleeves</li>
          <li>bruises</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          i may be strange for finding some of these adorable and awesome, but
          it is my own personal preference... i am a bit odd so i really like it
          when anime girls have those 'hurt' motifs about their designs
          (examples: abiru from sayonara zetsubou sensei, michiru sakurada from
          higanbana no saku yoru ni), and floppy sleeves are really cute
          (example: ougi from monogatari) ... capelets are my favorite clothing
          item of all time, this sparked from multiple characters i like
          including michiru sakurada, ayana otonashi, mgr from cookie, elma from
          black souls, veronica from franken fran, etc... i want to see more
          characters with my favorite moe attributes..!!! my
          <a href="https://eyeorb.net/pictures/laby_sona.png">sona</a> in
          particular has many of them because it is my sona and therefore of my
          own creation and choosing of how it will be designed muahahaha...

        <p>
          i cant stop starting videogames and then not finishing them i neeed
          those adhd pills but im scared of medicine and a lot of things in
          general my brain is kind of slop and i just kinda talk to myfriends on
          discord for hours upon hours lke for example like yesterday i stayed
          up until 12 am!!!!!!!!!! talking to my nekoweb friends theyre just way
          too cool and entertaining and i love them but i am NEVER or BAREYL
          productive ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh and i started
          studio system guardian angel today and its scary as shit (tm bought me
          it:3) and it is VERY COOL but scary as fuck but going to continue it
          and my life has been kind of weird recently there are many things that
          i think are going to change soon lol also cant stp drawing koishi and
          satori but cannot put anything worthy on here sadly. also just started
          getting sad crying again for reasons I cannot say did you know that
          mongolia is the most sparsely populated country and that kiviak is
          awesomne and i want to ttry salmiak and i would never try balut ever
          sorry filipinos. italians went off with maggot cheese please break the
          norm but id never try that. i would only try salmiak even if it burns
          off my tongue. surstromming looks nasty. today i continued to rot in
          my room and talk to my friends on discord for anotehr 50 hours. i have
          the worst blog of all time. i want to go to mongolia and lay in the
          steppe and let the earth consume me because i hate myself when things
          ive been used to for a long time change drastically .................
          i want to reread when they cry series a lot but i dont have a spare
          500 hours to waste that can fit in with all the other shit i do (like
          talk to friends on discord) did you know giant peruvian inca corn

        <h1>surrealism - 1/18/25</h1>
        <p>copy and pasted from my twitter</p>
        <p>
          ever since i was little i've been obsessed with the surreal and
          unknown, i love unexplainable things in fiction and open ended stories
          and i really hope to make my own one day. in 2016 i was obsessed with
          monument valley and that probably altered my brain chemistry for the
          rest of forever (game about a forgiveness seeking princess navigating
          impossible geometry) though in 2017-2019 i was obsessed with kids
          cartoons however never the 'realistic' ones, stuff like gumball +
          adventure time where theres still surreal elements in a way? and
          moomin but i guess it was the somewhat surreal aspect of a
          non-humanlike world i lost myself in. i've had a lot of interests that
          aren't exactly surreal actually but for the ones that are i've always
          loved them and held on to them (i've been a yume nikki fan since 2019)
          i dont like how a lot of normal people (NORMIES) hate unexplainable
          fiction so much like for one example, a couple weeks ago i put my
          history class on angel's egg muahahaha because we weren't doing
          anything and this one girl was like "Why is she pregnant. [i
          repeatedly said she's not pregnant it's an egg and it's up to
          interpretation] I don't understand this and i dont like it Why" which
          really annoyed me because people who look for answers too much in
          fiction immediately arent really Enjoying it they just want to know
          everything asap which isn't good you have to sloowly take in
          information and draw your own theories/conclusions when it comes to
          angels egg... i have serious problems with being able to finish stuff
          so i haven't been able to watch much of david lynch works but
          especially after his passing i would like to finish twin peaks, people
          like him are incredibly rare in this media climate of today. people
          don't want to be sincere and send a passionate message or idea anymore
          most of them just want to make money and make the audience laugh or
          entertained instead of thinking more deeply about topics and truly
          appreciating art.

        <h1>subahibi - 12/21/24</h1>
        <p>
          oh my god i finished rereading subahibi just now after putting off
          rereading it since i first read it in 2022, and oumajgaddddddd this is
          actually one of the best vns ive EVER read still... i really didn't
          appreciate it enough in 2022 so my mouth is kinda just hanging open by
          how blown away i am and im shaking a bit... the themes were extremely
          inspirational, i like the philosophy talk and think its interesting, i
          really like the characters (especially my wife ayana), i love the
          character designs, the overall messages it gives is incredibly amazing
          and i really like how the author, sca-ji, inserts so much of his
          thoughts and opinions into the work directly and its just so
          awesome... my favorite character is ayana and its been her for quite a
          while, but after rereading, my love for her as a character has
          amplified ... wow........................... and to contrast suba
          ayana with tsuire ayana, i think both of them are very very good and
          interesting but tsuire ayana is explored more, however that doesn't
          mean i will like suba ayana less of course. i am definitely going to
          cosplay ayana to anime boston, muahaha... and will make a
          subahibi/tsuire shrine soon as well...!!! after finishing this vn
          again, i am so much more inspired and motivated...

        <h1>anime boston - 12/20/24</h1>
        <p>
          i am very sorry this blog has been so suck recently lol... i want to
          stop venting so much when i try to think of stuff to write about. it's
          really cringe and i might purge the previous posts soon... anyways
          getting to what i was actually going to write about, i am going to go
          to anime boston next year, in may 2025. i think that this convention
          is really really good, and i like it a lot... i've been going every
          year since 2022. i would've been going much earlier but the pandemic
          happened unfortunately. i kind of wish i was able to experience
          pre-pandemic anime conventions, because the vibes seemed so much
          different before 2020. anime cons in general looked more genuine, and
          today there are many big conventions full of slop. but anime boston,
          in my opinion, isn't as bad as others. but take this with a grain of
          salt as the only anime con i've been to is anime boston lol. i've just
          heard from many others that cons like anime expo and anime nyc are
          full of slop sadly... yet anime boston feels realer if that makes
          sense. maybe i'm just looking at it with rose colored glasses since
          it's my local con. next year, i hope to cosplay koishi komeiji and
          ayana otonashi to it. one of my friends on twitter/discord is going to
          run an eroge panel, so i'm looking forward to that quite a bit...!
          additionally i am REALLY hoping i'll meet up with any online friend to
          walk around with because i don't have any irl friends that would be
          okay with me cosplaying from an eroge, probably... i mean i do have
          one peer at school that doesn't care about that kind of thing, however
          i think he is kind of annoying and we don't share any interests.

          ever..!! unfortunately this cannot distract from how my life has been
          so sucks and i am very depressed, i wish i could talk about it in
          detail a bit but its all really personal stuff ...
        </p>
        <p>
          although im so hollow <img src="pictures/DEATH.jpg" width="20" /> i am
          glad i am able to work on my site again.... getting ideas for things
          actually saves me from doing absolutely nothing lolll more people who
          are really depressed should force themselves to pick up hobbies
          because then you are both doing something worthwhile AND something to
          distract from the tormenting thoughts....
