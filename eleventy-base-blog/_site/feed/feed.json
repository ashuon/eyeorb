            "content_html": "<p>i've been collecting otaku merchandise since 2020. (the year i got my own card, although it was one of those prepaid kinds for kids, controlled by parents...)\nthe very first figure i got was remilia scarlet from touhou project, for my birthday in october 2020..!!! i still love her a lot but komeijis reign supreme above all\nother touhous i fear... here is a picture <br>\n<img src=\"https://eyeorb.net/img/remilia.jpg\" width=\"300\">\ni also have a decent collection of other anime figures as well... i've been accumulating them slowly over the course of 5 years. i have had MUCH more in the past,\nbut ive either sold them or gave them to family members lmao... picture below<br>\n<img src=\"https://eyeorb.net/img/merch1.png\" width=\"400\"><br>\nandddd let me show the merch wall... there are many many things on here and honestly not enough!!!!!!!!! if i had disposale income i would be spending it constantly....\n<img src=\"https://eyeorb.net/img/merch2.png\" width=\"400\"><br>\ni need more stuff of my goats (komeijis) and speaking of komeijis... i must show my ita bag of them because i love them so much (though i still feel like it could be improved)\n<img src=\"https://eyeorb.net/img/itabag.jpg\" width=\"300\"><br>\ni am very very passionate about merchandise, and have even made some myself.. i made keychains of shimeji simulation characters (majime and shijima) and ayana otonashi. i really\nwant to make more keychains, but they cost a lot of money to manufacture... i get mine from vograce and theyre really nice quality, and for a understandable price ($50 for 20 ayanas, $42 for 12 shimejis..) but ouhhh i live in the united states and oggg the tariffs are gonna GET vograce shaking my head i hope orange guy lifts the china tariffs eventually because i need to make more keychains and other kinds of merch perhaps like stickers.... i may be really materialistic because of my passion for merchandise but whatever its my money<br></p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>since i was little, i have always liked media of an interpretive or open ended nature,\nespecially ones of the surreal genre..... in a previous (much more schloppity schlop) blogpost,\ni had talked about something along the lines of this, so i will expand on that in a better way here. <br></p>\n<p>some examples of surreal media that fit this category are <b>angel's egg (1985)</b> and <b>cat soup (2001)</b>, two\nof my favorite movies of all time. (my only favorite movies tbh... i dont really watch movies much) they are both\nvery very beautiful and of a surreal nature, something that fits my niche perfectly. for me, i really like stories where\nthe setting/plot is something unrealistic and out of this world in a peculiar or unique way. such as shimeji simulation, for another example... there is\ngreat significance to me for stories where the author just lets their imagination run wild. i think that stories where its in way too realistic of a setting\nare very boring.............. but this can depend of course..! i really like hidamari sketch even though there isnt really anything avant-garde about it...<br></p>\n<p>avant-garde things, i really like in general. i like it when people create fiction or ideas that go out of the norm, even if it isnt always\nappealing to me.... as of late, the mainstream media of today's society seems to be imploding on itself. big movie studios only want to make remakes of\ntheir biggest hits for nostalgia bait, and when they DO make original stories again, they barely advertise them. and for books, it really seems like so many people\nonly want to consoom the schloppiest shit but maybe thats just booktok lmao, i dont use tiktok but i hear of stuff from it a lot... i try to buy books that appeal to me and are\nclassics and/or avant-garde, such as house of leaves and moby dick. i also read 1984 in school, for classics... getting back on topic, anime is victim of the sloppification as well.\nwhy do so many anime studios greenlight manga titled like &quot;I Got Transported To The Nether World And My Little Sister Is A Magical Demon God And She's In My Harem?!?!?&quot; and not\nstuff like shimeji simulation siiigh many people of today have no standards they just consoom whatever slop is put on their plate it seems.... i mean\nto each their own i guess but i really wish studios didn't just greenlight whatever would make the most money... <br></p>\n<p>i really want to make my own thing with my vague ideas one day, but i doubt i have the mental strength to deal with a wide audience for it... i already cant handle stupid\npeople talking about my interests lol. maybe one day ill make my own cool surreal video game or other piece of art... though, sometimes it just Never gets far. one of my\nfavorite rpgmaker games of all time is ghost suburb 2, yet nobody ever really talks about it except for the nichest of circles. which is good but also annoying because theres little\ndiscussion or fanart of it lol, please play it if you have a chance it's on gamejolt <a href=\"https://gamejolt.com/games/ghost-suburb-ii-from-sleep-into-the-eyes-of-madness/20897\">here...!!!</a>\n<br></p>\n",
