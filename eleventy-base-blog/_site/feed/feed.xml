    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;cool-new-blog-yay&quot;&gt;cool new blog yay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hello... i finally figured out how to use 11ty with the help of my very very awesome friend tm :pray:
it was tough to figure out how to do it at first, but got easier and easier... i really want to work on my site in
a more worthy way, like i currently feel like my site is just an art project/portfolio and not much else.. i want to
contribute good stuff to people..!!!!! an idea thats been floating around in my head for a while is having a recipes or food
creations page, i think that would be cool... one of my favorite blogs of all time is &lt;a href=&quot;https://touhousweets.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;touhousweets&lt;/a&gt;
on tumblr. i really want to make food themed after my favorite things like that, i think it would be really cool but i don&#39;t really have ideas often
and i&#39;m trying to lose weight anyways... :smiling_face_with_tear:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as of late i am pretty confident about the future, but with some things im not so confident about, like getting a job..... i really need to
save money for anime boston happening in two months!!! but i havent been able to get money lately due to a lack of commissions and workplaces getting back to me
about my applications... :graah: i hope i find a way to make more money soon... i really need to lock in but life is not handing me opportunities that much i fear&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i also applied to a college this weekend. if i don&#39;t get in (slim chance of being rejected i think) idk what ill do since i dont really have alternatives that
i want to get into right now heeelpppp but i have high hopes...!!!! i really want to go to that college for a year or two and then transfer to a university in boston, for the
reason that i will get a much better opportunity to study what i actually want to...(which is linguistics and world history) among other reasons..... :happ:.....................
for this college in boston, the application window for first-year students closed months ago sadly, so i had to apply to a more nearby college. i&#39;ll get my credits in for the more local college, and then transfer...!!!!!!!!!!!! i must get a good job somewhere like the museum of fine arts in boston..&lt;/p&gt;
