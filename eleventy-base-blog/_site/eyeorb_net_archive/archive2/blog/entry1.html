      first thing, right after when i got home from yet another vacation to
      fl*rida (hate fl*rida) i got my satori figure in the mail .. she is very
      awesome and i like her so much so i am happy with my purchase. she was for
      a very cheap price too, only $24 instead of other sellers selling for
      wayyyy more. this is a very very good addition to

      second thing ! i started reading franken fran (a veri veri cool manga)
      yesterday, and finished it today. it is really good. i like it a lot and
      the characters are very silly, the stories vary in quality and i cant say
      i have a favorite story from the many chapters but i really really like
      veronica, she is so funny and silly and i like her design a lot. if you
      are going to read franken fran, warning for gore (a LOT of it, including with
      animals), violence, sexual violence, cannibalism, nudity, mild sexual content (mostly the volume covers lol), and even more. . .
