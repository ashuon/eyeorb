      else to talk about for this paragraph

      black souls' gradual popularity scares meeee i played both the games back
      in january (5 months ago) and they are my favorite rpgmaker game series ever
      but its gradually getting attention from <i>those</i> egirl people (such
      as the fake visual novel fans who like subahibi/saya no uta/totono just
      for the aesthetic and/or to be quirky or edgy), "normal people" who
      denounce everything about the game either just because its eroge or just
      because its VERY fucked up/"problematic", and etc... my main fear is it becoming viral
      on tiktok or elsewhere and toro (the creator) gets harrassed :( i honestly
      hate that stuff cant be niche anymore without stupid ass people eventually
      ruining it
