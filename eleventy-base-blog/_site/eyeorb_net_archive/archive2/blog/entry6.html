      two blog posts in the same month!???! wtf.. but anyways i have been
      struggling with paranoia way too much recently....! its craazy how often i
      start wanting to run away from everything whenever i build a presence
      ANYWHERE public .... i abandoned my old neocities because i got paranoid
      of all the eyes(lol) i had on me and i had around 25 followers then, but
      now i have 61 on here....brrrrrrrruuuuujjhhhhhh its such a problem i hate
      being percieved way too much im legit traumatized and very mentally
      ill/autism so guhhhhh guhhhh guhh. i have deactivated my public twitter
      art accounts twice now and theyre deleted forever.. i hate hate hate being
      known im trying to deal by being like Yeah idont CARE what strangers think
      of me but its still terrifying to think about maybe i should remov ethat
      from my index page possibly . tldr if this website is suddenly wiped DO
      NOT look for me please, unless i know you personally

      8/30/24 update: i dont really mind if you still decide to follow me or
      interact with me after i post this, the anxiety fluctuates a LOT so most
      days im relatively okay but other days....
