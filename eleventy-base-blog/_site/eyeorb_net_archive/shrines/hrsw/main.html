<p>welcome</p>
<p>this is my <span style="color: #cacdf7;">susumu hirasawa</span> shrine, 
something like this was originally made in 2023 on my old neocities, but it 
won't see the light of day again. i wanted to revive it, so here...</p>
<p>susumu hirasawa is an extremely unique musician that can't exactly be put into one specific genre at all,
mainly famous for doing anime soundtracks (especially berserk and satoshi kon works). beyond that, 
he has an extremely extensive and beautiful discography. i first became a fan in october 2021, 
through x0o0x's cover of big brother - kaku p-model. i listened to vistoron soon after that, and then siren.
these were the only two albums i really listened to from him at the time, until i met someone that made me 
listen to the rest of his discography (all p-model, all kaku p-model, all solo works, and even mandrake) and 
i've been extremely obsessed since.
</p>
<p>
hirasawa's music is surreal yet worldly, it's really something extremely special and i want more people 
to discover him past the anime soundtrack work. his music means a LOT to me, i am such a big fan and i really wish 
i could go to japan for even more merchandise, concerts, etc. he is a very eccentric person, and i am of the belief that 
truly eccentric people make the absolute best art. boring, uninspired people only make the most boring, uninspired things. 
we need more people that are genuine and unique in the world, and he is one of my inspirations (besides the questionable 
beliefs, but with eccentric people like him, there's pretty much always going to be something you disagree with about someone). 
everyone should strive to stand out and contribute something good in a unique way like him, i think... his music is so so so
beautiful... if i were to recommend 5 hirasawa albums to a beginner, i'd probably say:
