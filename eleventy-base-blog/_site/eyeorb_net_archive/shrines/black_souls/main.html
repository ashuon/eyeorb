    <q>Described as battle-crazed and non-expressive. Miranda often speaks with
    few words, sometimes uttering only a single word. She respects strength as a
    result of her upbringing and only likes strong people. Unlike other members
    of the Black Trial, she holds no loyalty to it as she understands she is
    just a tool to Baphomet. As such, she immediately abandons the Black Trial
    for Grimm if he proves victorious over her, believing losers should follow
    the winner's wishes. Despite her dogmatic view, she seemingly desires to be
    loved. In Black Souls II, Hein describes her as having become "much more
    human." While still believing in strength, she is more caring of her
    friends, and preaches to Jabberwock the importance of giving love.</q>
