            <title>energy</title>
            <description>i have been feeling an extreme amount of low energy, and its only
            getting worse.... i recently got diagnosed with anemia so that
            explains it but i havent been taking anything to help it which is My
            Fault. i can't really do much without getting tired and wanting to
            lay down... i do want to get better but also at the same time its
            like i dont care whatsoever.</description>

            <title>moe....</title>
            <description>lets pray this is my first coherent post....
oftentimes when people think about "moe", they think of big anime eyes and general cuteness...
but what about unconventional "moe" traits? it could be anything you find cute within the realm of otakuism, 
in my opinion... for me, there are many things i like that i consider moe. some of these things include: </description>

            <title>surrealism</title>
            <description> ever since i was little i've been obsessed with the surreal and
          unknown, i love unexplainable things in fiction and open ended stories
          and i really hope to make my own one day. in 2016 i was obsessed with
          monument valley and that probably altered my brain chemistry for the
          rest of forever (game about a forgiveness seeking princess navigating
          impossible geometry) </description>

            <title>subahibi</title>
            <description> oh my god i finished rereading subahibi just now after putting off
          rereading it since i first read it in 2022, and oumajgaddddddd this is
          actually one of the best vns ive EVER read still... i really didn't
          appreciate it enough in 2022 so my mouth is kinda just hanging open by
          how blown away i am and im shaking a bit... the themes were extremely
          inspirational, i like the philosophy talk and think its interesting, i
          really like the characters (especially my wife ayana </description>

            <title>anime boston</title>
            <description>i am very sorry this blog has been so suck recently lol... i want to stop venting so much when i try to think of stuff to write about. 
	  it's really cringe and i might purge the previous posts soon... anyways getting to what i was actually going to write about, i am going to go 
	  to anime boston next year, in may 2025. i think that this convention is really really good, and i like it a lot... i've been going every year 
	  since 2022. i would've been going much earlier but the pandemic happened unfortunately. i kind of wish i was able to experience pre-pandemic 
	  anime conventions, because the vibes seemed so much different before 2020. anime cons in general looked more genuine, and today there are many 
	  big conventions full of slop. but anime boston, in my opinion, isn't as bad as others.</description>

            <title>my first blog post(not really)</title>
            <description>i've been working on this new version of my website for 3 days straight now, and although i 
	  am writing this before my site is open again, i am very proud of the work 
	  i have accomplished thus far, i might even say the most recent pages have been 
	  my best web design work ever..!! unfortunately this cannot distract from how my life has been 
	  so sucks and i am very depressed, i wish i could talk about it in detail a bit 
	  but its all really personal stuff ...</description>
