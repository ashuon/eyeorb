    <q>Pathologic Classic HD is the Definitive Edition of the original Cult Classic
    Psychological First-Person Survival game. The game represents a unique and
    unforgettable experience as it transports players in a weird town which
    crouches, ominous, in the far reaches of an ancient steppe. It was once a
    small drover settlement, huddled around a monstrous abattoir—but something
    about the butchery it was near has changed it. It has developed an odd
    social structure over the course of several generations. It could have
    quietly continued along its weird way, but a sudden outbreak of an unknown
    and inevitably lethal disease has decimated the citizens. Prayers did not
    help. Science did not help. So, finally, they have turned to outsiders for
    help: three of them enter the town in hope of finding a cure or—failing
    that—an explanation.</q>
