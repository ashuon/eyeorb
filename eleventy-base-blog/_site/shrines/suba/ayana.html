<p>ayana as a character is very cool to me... i really like the concept of "mysterious girl who says strange 
things that are actually very insightful and important". she's me (sort of idk), she's my wife, marriage with her is shared between me and 
two other friends, and she is just TOO COOL... originally kimika was my favorite subahibi character but not anymore, that 
was back in 2022 and i am much different now. ive said this 1 billion times but i WILL cosplay her... 
she is the greatest </p>
