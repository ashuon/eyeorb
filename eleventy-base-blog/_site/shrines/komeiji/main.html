<p> this is a shrine dedicated to satori komeiji and koishi komeiji from touhou project. they are very special to me for various reasons, but one of them is that i love eye orbs and eyes and everything to do with them as a motif and concept. i also relate to koishi and see myself in her, due to various factors that i will not get into.

i started loving koishi and satori in december 2023, despite being a touhou fan since 2020, and have had a special interest since. i don't know why i didn't earlier, considering i got obsessed with the concept of orb eyes a while before. later on, i watched koishi komeiji's heart-throbbing adventure, which after finishing became one of my favorite things ever. i really love it, even if a lot of people hate it and think it "ruined koishi" when i think its really awesome. honestly maybe it did ruin people's perceptions of koishi in a way, but i love kkhta anyways. i love the shittiness and edgyness of it early on, and how much it had changed throughout and near the ending. i am excitedly waiting for the last part, if it ever comes out, despite the recent news.

<p>i love to look at fanart of them, any fanart ever, and have went through 
danbooru tags for them many times. i also am currently making a koishi 
cosplay at school. it will take a while... i hope to have it in time for 
anime boston 2025. </p>
