<p><q>Shimeji Simulation follows Shijima Tsukishima, a former 
    hikikomori who decides to attend high school after spending
     two years in her closet. As she gets ready for school, she 
     finds shimeji mushrooms have sprouted from her head. Later, 
     at school, Shijima is approached by Majime Yamashita, a
      girl with a fried egg on her own head, which she says 
      she was born with. The two bond while more strange events 
      happen in their town. </q></p>
