              >RPG Maker, known in Japan as RPG Tsukūru (RPGツクール, sometimes
              romanized as RPG Tkool), is a series of programs for the
              development of role-playing video games (RPGs) with story-driven
              elements, created by the Japanese group ASCII, succeeded by
              Enterbrain, and then by Gotcha Gotcha Games. The Japanese name,
              Tsukūru, is a pun mixing the Japanese word tsukuru (作る), which
              means "make" or "create", with tsūru (ツール), the Japanese
              transliteration of the English word "tool".
