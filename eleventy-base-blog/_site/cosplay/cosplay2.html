            i really like cosplay, cosplay culture, cosplay history, and being a cosplayer... i
            have gone to anime boston every year since 2022. i have been
            cosplaying since 2019, but the pandemic happened and i had not
            gotten the chance to go to any anime conventions until 2022, like i
            said. currently, i unfortunately just buy cosplays since i am too
            unmotivated to make my own (and also no job rn), but i would really
            really like to. i plan to make a koishi komeiji cosplay by hand for
            anime boston 2025, if i go through with the plan. i really don't want to buy the poor quality/suspicious
            looking amazon and aliexpress koishi cosplays, so if all else i'll
            just commission one.

            i currently have cosplays of <b>yuuri from girls' last tour</b>,
            <b>clara from pathologic</b>, <b>rena ryuugu from higurashi</b>, and
            thats it (i have had many other cosplays in the past, but i have
            either sold them or am never going to wear them anymore.)
          </p>
          <p>
            my current cosplans are: <b>koishi komeiji from touhou project</b>,
            <b>mabel from black souls 2</b>, <b>node from black souls 2</b>,
            <b>ayana otonashi from subarashiki hibi</b>, <b>miranda from black souls 2</b>, and
            <b>victoria from black souls 2</b>. however, the koishi cosplay is the most likely
            one right now.
