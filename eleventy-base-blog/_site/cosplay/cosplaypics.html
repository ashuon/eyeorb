  i don't have any good cosplay pictures right now.. weird yes? it's because i
  haven't taken any in a long time due to being unmotivated, but hopefully i
  will be able to upload some soon.... i heavily dislike the summer for a lot of reasons but one of them is because a
  lot of my cosplays or cosplans are pretty warm ones
