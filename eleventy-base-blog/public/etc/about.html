        <h1 style="text-align:center;">welcome</h1>
        <p>this is a web clique dedicated to resonating with objects/concepts of a surreal/otherworldly nature, similar to the concept of "dreamcore" but please do not call it that..</p>
   <h1 style="text-align:center;">what is a web clique?</h1>
   <p>a web clique, or simply just called clique, is a group of people with personal websites who all share a common interest or thing, and they put a piece of code on their website to signify this.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;">what are the rules?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>you must have your own personal <i>hand-coded</i> website to put it on (this does not include carrds/rentry, social media sites, or messaging apps)</li>
        <li>you must not have anything violently hateful or offensive on your site (i cant control people, so only abide by this if you were looking to be added to the members list)</li>
        <li>please put the code up in an easily-findable place, if you want to be added to the list (this just makes things easier for me)</li>
        <li>you can put in a custom object/concept if you want, just really make sure it fits the theme. you cannot put "cat" for example, because that is a super common thing and not immediately associated with anything surreal.</li>
    </ul>
