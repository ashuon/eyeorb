<p>this manga is VERY VERY GOOD. i have read it 
    twice now, and it is due for a 3rd read...!! 
    it is very silly, sad, surreal, interesting, and unique... 
    i love it soooo much and when i read it a 3rd time i may update with 
    more thoughts. i had first read it in summer of 2023, and i don't 
    remember when i reread it. tkmiz is a very talented and interesting 
    individual, i very very much enjoy girls' last tour and flan wants to 
    die as well. i cosplayed yuuri to anime boston in 2024 in fact..!! 
    tkmiz's works are very special to me, so i hope that with making this shrine 
    makes more people check his work out. sakana
