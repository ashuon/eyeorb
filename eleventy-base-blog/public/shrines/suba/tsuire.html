	   <p>along with <span style="color:#CCCCFF;">subarashiki hibi/wonderful everyday</span>, there is also 
	   <span style="color:#d39eff;">tsui no sora remake</span> and <span style="color: #a1c6ae">tsui no sora 1999</span>. 
	   i've read tsui no sora remake, but not tsui1999 (yet... a translation will come out soon), so i will just talk 
	   about tsuire here for now.<br>
	   tsui no sora remake was what subahibi was going to be originally, but subahibi grew more and more and 
	   ended up being its own thing with new ideas. it was based off tsui no sora 1999. but tsui no sora remake is a 
	   much more proper remake. both subahibi and tsuire are very good, and i can't really choose between them. the ayanas 
	   in them are a little different from each other, but i love all ayanas. you will learn about my love for ayana 
	   with the next page hehehe....
