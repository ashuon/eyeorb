        this is a shrine dedicated to satori komeiji and koishi komeiji from
        touhou project. they are very special to me for various reasons, but one
        of them is that i love eye orbs and eyes and everything to do with them
        as a motif and concept. i also relate to koishi and see myself in her,
        due to various factors that i will not get into.

        i started loving koishi and satori in december 2023, despite being a
        touhou fan since 2020, and have had a special interest since. i don't
        know why i didn't earlier, considering i got obsessed with the concept
        of orb eyes a while before. later on, i watched koishi komeiji's
        heart-throbbing adventure, which after finishing became one of my
        favorite things ever. i really love it, even if a lot of people hate it
        and think it "ruined koishi" when i think its really awesome. honestly
        maybe it did ruin people's perceptions of koishi in a way, but i love
        kkhta anyways. i love the shittiness and edgyness of it early on, and
        how much it had changed throughout and near the ending. i am excitedly
        waiting for the last part, if it ever comes out, despite the recent
        news.
