      from discogs: Kaku P-Model is a solo project launched in 2004 by Susumu
      Hirasawa, the leader of P-Model, a band that led the Japanese new wave
      scene in the 1980s and 1990s. While maintaining its style as the "core" of<br>
      P-Model, he is constantly evolving his own style with each new release, as
      P-Model used to be.
