    pathologic classic hd is very cool and awesome to me, it is one of my
    favorite video games of all time and clara is me real.... i finished it in
    november 2023, and am writing this in september 2024. i love the characters
    and story and setting and everything and i think its so magnificent... if
    you did not notice i mentioned classic hd and not path2. that is because i
    think path2 is a serious downgrade in some aspects... such as, i think the
    new clara design is fucking ugly and i hate her voice. she looks like a
    middle aged woman with the voice of a british person, as opposed to her
    childlike/teenager appearance and young voice in classic hd... BUT i still
    want to play pathologic 2 eventually, just when i get a pc because my
    current windows laptop absolutely cannot run it lol.

    going off what i said about clara, i think its annoying how little the
    fandom draws her and if they DO draw her its usually her pathologic 2
    design. this is literally just a personal petty opinion of mine and nobody
    has to agree with me, but i really wish there were more classic hd clara
    fanarts. and yes, the fandom mainly focuses on the Gay Yaoi Men Pairing most
    of all out of everything in the series (its annoying as fuck please focus on
    something other than shipping and headcanons) AND a lot of people really
    didn't like clara's route, but i think it was awesome and i liked it even if
    it was unfinished... im hoping that in pathologic 2 if the clara route for
    that ever comes out that she will finally get the fleshed out route she
    deserves......
