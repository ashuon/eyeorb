      it was my birthday on the 6th, i am now 18... just didnt feel like
      updating my site for a long time ... i got a gaming pc and ive been using
      it a lot. before then, i had a mac laptop and a really shitty windows
      laptop ive had since 2018 that barely ran well. i am very glad to finally
      have this pc because i can do so much more now. i've been playing
      webfishing a lot recently, and today i played risk of rain 2 with friends.

      hmm what else is going on... i have been trying to find a job and have
      been applying to many places with only one responding to me saying yeah we
      can schedule an interview, and then they cancelled it and said they'll
      reschedule, but then they ghosted me until i called and asked about the
      interview, and thenn they had a response of saying "oh we filled the
      position already" GRRR

      the reason i want to get a job so badly is because i really want to save
      up to go to two anime cons in 2025, anime boston and touhoufest. mostly
      touhoufest, since i'm going to have to pay for a lot (plane ticket, hotel,
      con ticket, cosplay, merch.......) i live in massachusetts so anime boston
      is way easier to get to. i've been planning to make a koishi cosplay from
      scratch, and bought a lot of fabric for it. i got a sewing machine for my
      birthday, so i hopefully should get a lot done. i also will have an ita
      bag with lots of merch too....
