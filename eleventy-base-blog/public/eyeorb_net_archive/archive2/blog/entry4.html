      it may seem strange to some but i am actually a very lonely person..... i
      don't like 90% of people that exist so maybe that's a factor but it is
      also very hard to go out in the world because i am terrified of
      everything.......... i haven't befriended any very new people (except for
      like..one person? kind of..) in over a year at this point because i am so
      secluded. i barely have any irl friends too, and my only real irl friend
      that i see at school is extremely dull and usually doesn't want to talk to
      me, sleeps in class, etc. it makes me very sad because we both like touhou
      and i try to encourage them to get into my favorite things but they don't
      want to. i wish i had more friends, but i can't connect with many people
      at all besides the people i already know. everyone i either hate or would
      hate me, because of how offputting i am... i haven't unprivated the
      twitter account i talk on in over a year for various reasons (such as 1.
      scary 2. scary 3. if one of my tweets get quote retweeted i start freaking
      out majorly and ripping off my skin etc.) its very sad. honestly in
      general please don't approach me to try to be friends if i don't approach
      you first (such as following you or interacting in general) otherwise ill
      get really scared... im moderately autistic so life is very hard for me
