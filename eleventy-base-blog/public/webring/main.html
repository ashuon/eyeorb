<h1>cosplay webring</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">what is a webring?</h2>
<p>from wikipedia: <span style="color: #2d2d2d"><q>A webring (or web ring) is a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure, usually organized around a specific theme, and often educational or social. They were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly among amateur websites. </q></span> </p>
<h2 style="text-align: right;">what are the rules?</h2>
<p>the cosplayer webring is for all people who cosplay and are interested 
in finding other cosplayers on the indie web. however, you may not join if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you harass or 'call out' others for reasons that are not inherently harmful to another human being
 - whether it be over appearance, their taste in media/fiction (even if not platable to you), their hobbies, their cosplay skill level,
 etc</li>
<li>you are genuinely bigoted or generally hateful, or host hateful content</li>
<li>you have a dni list of any sort on the indie web</li>
<li>you don't have a personal website, coded by you - this webring does <b>NOT</b> include carrd, rentry, strawpage, etc.</li>
