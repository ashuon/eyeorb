  <h1>my beliefs and worldview</h1>
  <p>
    i generally do not agree with hatred for aspects humans have that they
    cannot control. i don't consider myself to be any sort of political
    affiliation, but i'd probably be left leaning in the sense that i just dont
    like inequity. despite this, i still have types of internet people i
    absolutely disagree with from all fronts...
  </p>
  <p>
    i do not agree with and often despise people who have hatred for others for
    things they do not understand. dni lists are a plague among a lot of people
    around my age online. if you have one, and it has things on it like "die
    proshippers" or "die problematic media fans", then i do not want to be
    around you. i have too much experiences from being in that extremely moral
    part of the internet that i want nothing to do with it anymore. i am
    pro-whatever you want
  </p>
  <p>
    not sure what else to write for this to be quite honest, i don't really want
    to spread a lot of negativity anyways, these are just some of my main
    thoughts floating around about what i believe in, i'll update this if i
    think of more i guess
