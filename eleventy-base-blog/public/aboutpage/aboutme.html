    <img src="koishi_wobble.gif" width="190" style="float:left;" />i am laby...
    this is my site for dumping whatever i want and coding and designing pages
    creatively, and expressing myself through passion for my interests and
    hobbies. <a href="https://eyeorb.net/pictures/laby_sona.png">this</a> is my
    sona. i am incredibly obsessed with satori and koishi from touhou project. 
    i have been a webmaster since 2021, but only started taking it
    seriously in 2023. since then, i've been continuously dedicated to making
    websites because i am very bored all the time. i am very passionate about
    what i like, and i hope to share them with others who get me. i hope that
    having this website will inspire others to be as creative and unique as
    me... i am an autist pretty secluded from the rest of society irl, and
    prefer to stay in my own personal bubble with a lot of things. i prefer to
    hold my own beliefs and opinions as opposed to listening to the majority of
    society or large groups. i think everyone should stay true to themselves
    instead of trying to appeal to the masses constantly.... i am against the
    concept of "do not interact" lists and percieved normalcy, people should
    just do whatever they want while also setting boundaries in other ways, such
    as simply blocking or unfollowing....
