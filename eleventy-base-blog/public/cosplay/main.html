<h1>cosplay zone</h1>
<p>since 2019, this hobby has been very prominent for me.. in fact, it may be one of my biggest interests ever. i really really like cosplay... 
    i even wrote my college application essay on it... u_u<br>
    i've cosplayed probably around 15 characters in the past, but unfortunately i DO NOT want to talk about 70% of those past cosplays lmao (relatable experience 
    for many cosplayers i am sure). the cosplays i have right now are yuuri (girls last tour), suiseiseki (rozen maiden) but i want to get rid of it D:, 
    koishi komeiji (touhou) which is handmade(most of it), ayana otonashi (subahibi), rena ryuugu (higurashi), and clara (pathologic).<br>
    i got into sewing my own cosplays as of recent. before, i would just buy them online in varying quality.... my high school's art room had a really good 
    sewing machine (janome travelmate 30) so i would work on my koishi komeiji cosplay at school, almost every day for about 3-4 months... but it was very worth it 
    in the end because i now had a koishi cosplay that didnt look like shit ! (though there are a LOT of uneven stitches on my koishi cosplay lol...)<br>
    i hope to get my own janome tm30, hopefully when i graduate high school in two months i will get it as a graduation gift or something... (it is april 14th at 
    the time of writing this..!!)<br>
