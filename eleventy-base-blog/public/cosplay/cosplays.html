    <h1>cosplay pics</h1>
    <p>here are some (mid) cosplay pictures, i cannot take better ones that aren't mirror selfies
     right now due to how i refuse to let my family take pictures for me... grrrr<br>
    </p>
    <img src="koishi_cosplay.jpg" width="250">
    <p>this is my koishi komeiji cosplay, finished a few days ago. like i said on the main page, it took me 3-4 months to 
        make, all at school... well, just the torso+sleeves, collar, and skirt (i bought everything else lol) i am very very 
        proud of it and excited to bring it to anime boston 2025!!!!!! also in the picture i was too lazy to tie my shoes and attach the 
        hearts to the shoes AND i had to hold up the eyeorb because the fastener on it broke. ignore..
    </p><br>
    
    <img src="ayana_cosplay_pic_c.png" width="250">
    <p>my ayana cosplay.... i bought it online like 99% of other subahibi cosplayers i gotta admit. its okay quality but works, however the torso part 
        i dont really fit in like it wont button up very good and that makes me wanna drink 9999 alcohols im ngl but i will lose weight hopefully... 
        i do want to sew my own subahibi cosplay from scratch one day..!! i will wear this ayana cosplay to anime boston 2025 as well, if you see me 
        i'll give you one of my ayana keychains for free!!!!!!!

        first off, if you recognize this picture from <em>anywhere</em> specifically a certain thread on a certain imageboard YOU DID NOT. anyways 
        i wore this yuuri cosplay to anime boston 2024 last year.... its a pretty nice cosplay.. i wish that when i went to anime boston last year it 
        wasn't boring as hell that year though, i barely saw any cosplayers of stuff i liked and didn't really buy much.
