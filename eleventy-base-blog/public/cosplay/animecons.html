    <h1>anime conventions</h1>
    <p>i've been going to anime boston since 2022. i would've been going since 2019 or 2020, but for 2019 i went to SHITTY SHITTY FAN EXPO BOSTON instead and for 
        2020 The Virus hit lmao... anime boston is my favorite convention of all time, but to be fair its the only anime con ive been to since its the nearest to me..<br>
        i take quite a bit of photos there usually, but last year i only got around FOUR <img src="GRAAH.jpg" width="20"> which was very sad, i dont know why that year was 
        so boring........... i hope (as of writing this) that anime boston 2025 will be Really Cool. i'll be meeting up with some oomfies so it will hopefully be very awesome... 
        additionally theres's going to be a visual novel panel ran by my oomfie too!!
    </p>
