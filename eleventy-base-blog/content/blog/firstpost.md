hello... i finally figured out how to use 11ty with the help of my very very awesome friend tm :pray: 
it was tough to figure out how to do it at first, but got easier and easier... i really want to work on my site in 
a more worthy way, like i currently feel like my site is just an art project/portfolio and not much else.. i want to 
contribute good stuff to people..!!!!! an idea thats been floating around in my head for a while is having a recipes or food 
creations page, i think that would be cool... one of my favorite blogs of all time is <a href="https://touhousweets.tumblr.com">touhousweets</a> 
on tumblr. i really want to make food themed after my favorite things like that, i think it would be really cool but i don't really have ideas often 
and i'm trying to lose weight anyways... :smiling_face_with_tear:<br>

as of late i am pretty confident about the future, but with some things im not so confident about, like getting a job..... i really need to 
save money for anime boston happening in two months!!! but i havent been able to get money lately due to a lack of commissions and workplaces getting back to me 
about my applications... :graah: i hope i find a way to make more money soon... i really need to lock in but life is not handing me opportunities that much i fear<br>

i also applied to a college this weekend. if i don't get in (slim chance of being rejected i think) idk what ill do since i dont really have alternatives that 
i want to get into right now heeelpppp but i have high hopes...!!!! i really want to go to that college for a year or two and then transfer to a university in boston, for the 
reason that i will get a much better opportunity to study what i actually want to...(which is linguistics and world history) among other reasons..... :happ:.....................
for this college in boston, the application window for first-year students closed months ago sadly, so i had to apply to a more nearby college. i'll get my credits in for the more local college, and then transfer...!!!!!!!!!!!! i must get a good job somewhere like the museum of fine arts in boston..
